# Naan mudhalvan project

Creating a web application for  Online Complaint Registration and Management system (street light, water pipe leakage, rainwater drainage, road)

## Problem Statement

The major goal of this project is to assist the general population in learning about their location and resolving their problems online rather than visiting the officer on a frequent basis until the situation is resolved. The public can save time and money by using this approach, and corruption in government offices can be eliminated. Its primary goal is to give a smart and simple method for registering complaints, tracking them, and eliminating them via an Android or web application, so preventing corruption. We want to create an app for a complaint management system where people can report problems with street lights, water pipes, rainwater drainage, road renovation, and waste collection. To convert a manual compliance management system into an automated system. For better complaint management and increased efficiency. The idea for  projects All persons who live in housing schemes societies in India can use applications to register their complaints.
